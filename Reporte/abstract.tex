\abstract{In this article we study the Fourier series and transforms and their application in Physics, specifically we will focus on chaos theory, the Lorentz attractor and the problem of the non-relativistic quantum free particle, using various algorithms focused on the obtaining the Fourier transform with some mathematical methods. Among them we have the Discrete Fourier Transform or DFT and the Fast Fourier Transform, better known by the abbreviation FFT which is considered one of the best ten algorithms developed during the 20th century.}
